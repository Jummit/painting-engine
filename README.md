# Godot Painting Engine

A 3D painting engine aiming to be on par with Substance Painter's features.

## Building

This project uses an experimental [package manager](https://github.com/Jummit/godot-package-manager). To install the dependencies, download the package manager and run this before opening the project in Godot:

```bash
./gopm.py --install
```

Only tested on Linux.
